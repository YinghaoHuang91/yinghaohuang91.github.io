# Recruitment Advertisement for PhD / Master Students, and Research Assistants

Hi there! I am Dr. Yinghao Huang, currently a Post-doc Reseacher working with [Professor Taku Komura](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~taku/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) (from August of 2023). Before moving to Hong Kong, I spent 7 years in Germany and earned my PhD degree (December of 2022) in Computer Science from [Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligetn Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), under the guidance of [Director Michael J. Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black). I also interned at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) and worked full-time at [Momenta GmbH Europe](https://www.momenta.cn/en/). 

I work at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning, and mainly focus on research problems related to 3D Humans. My past research works include [3D Human Shape and Pose Estimation from Multi-view Videos](https://ps.is.mpg.de/publications/muvs-3dv-2017), [Lightweight and Real-time 3D Pose Estimation from Sparse IMUs](https://dip.is.tue.mpg.de/), and [Joint Markerless Reconstruction of Humans and Objects](https://intercap.is.tue.mpg.de/). You can find the full list of my publications via my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3KJzwEAAAAJ). I hold broad interests in various aspects of human body research, including but not limited to Next Generatino Motion Capture (MoCap), Appearance and Geometry Modelling, Capture and Modelling of Interactive Behaviors between Humans, objects and the surrounding environments. 

I will join the newly estiablished [Great Bay University](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/?lang=en) as a Tenure-Tracking Assistant Professor at [School of Computing and Information Technology](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/menu/177) sometime later this year. I will found and head a new laboratory tentatively called CHL for Computational Humans Lab. Now I am recruting PhD and Master students, and also Research Assistants. Just as the name CHL indicates, the topics will be centered around 2D or 3D Humans. I plan to continue my previous research effort for the advancement of Virtual Human Technologies. 

If you are interested to work with me on the aforementioned topics, please do not hesitate to write me an email to arrange a detailed discussion. The correspondence should be addressed to yinghao_huang_91@gmail.com with the two underscores removed, and along with the enquiry email please also include: 1) one detaild CV, 2) why you want to work with me, and 3) contact details of two to three referees. The language can be either English or Chinese.
