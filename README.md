# Recruitment Advertisement for PhD / Master Students, and Research Assistants

Hi there! I am Dr. Yinghao Huang, currently a Post-doc Reseacher working with [Professor Taku Komura](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~taku/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) (from August of 2023). Before moving to Hong Kong, I spent 7 years in Germany and earned my PhD degree (December of 2022) in Computer Science from [Max-Planck-Institute for Intelligetn Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), under the guidance of [Director Michael J. Black](https://ps.is.mpg.de/person/black). I also interned at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) and worked full-time at [Momenta GmbH Europe](https://www.momenta.cn/en/). 

I work at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning, and mainly focus on research problems related to 3D Humans. My past research works include [3D Human Shape and Pose Estimation from Multi-view Videos](https://ps.is.mpg.de/publications/muvs-3dv-2017), [Lightweight and Real-time 3D Pose Estimation from Sparse IMUs](https://dip.is.tue.mpg.de/), and [Joint Markerless Reconstruction of Humans and Objects](https://intercap.is.tue.mpg.de/). You can find the full list of my publications via my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C3KJzwEAAAAJ). I hold broad interests in various aspects of human body research, including but not limited to Next Generatino Motion Capture (MoCap), Appearance and Geometry Modelling, Capture and Modelling of Interactive Behaviors between Humans, objects and the surrounding environments.
